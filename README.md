-   Submit your app **by creating a pull request**, which one of the tutors will review.
    -   Requirements NOT met: The tutor asks you to update your pull request.
    -   Requirements met: The tutor will accept the pull request.
-   The **Deadline** is **20.04.2022, 11:59 PM**
    -   Make sure to submit your solution **at least one week earlier**, allowing sufficient time for pull request reviews by tutors.

    -   After accepting you submission, we may invite you to a short interview to ensure that you implemented your Mandatory Assignment without the help of third parties.

## Requirements

The table below lists all of the requirements to your iPhone app in a short form. Refer to the [detailed list with hints and how-to's](https://confluence.ase.in.tum.de/display/IOS22CW/Intro+Course%3A+Mandatory+Assignment) while working on your app.

After verifying that you implemented each of them, put a ✅ into the *Implemented* column before submitting the pull request for review. Don't touch the *Fulfilled* column, it will be filled by your tutor.

> Submissions without a ✅ in each row will not be reviewed but rejected for another revision.
